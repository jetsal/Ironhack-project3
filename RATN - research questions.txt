# Race Around the Netherlands - research questions

## Introduction
Every year a bunch of cycling-fanatics set of to Race Around the Netherlands. This is a 1.913km long race with 4.164m elevation starting and ending in Amerongen (Utrecht). The route is predetermined, the rest is up to the riders. They have 9 days to finish the ride.
The race is not as much a race against competitors, as it is a race against the elements and well, quite frankly, a very painful backside.
Detailed race-data is available for the 2018-2021 editions, which will be the topic of this project.

## Research questions
#### THE WEATHER
The race is held in spring, and Dutch springs can be very capracious. Headwind, rain and low temperatures can slow you down and lower morale. We try to find out:
1). how the weather affects the time it takes riders to reach the finish line
2). if the weather affects if riders give up more often and/or more quickly (earlier in the route). 

#### MEN VERSUS WOMEN
3). Both men and women ride the same route. Women usually ride slower, which means: more days in the saddle. How many more days do women need on average?
4). Men may be faster than women, but who are tougher? What is the average DNF rate of men versus women, and at which point do they give up? 

#### THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS?
5). There are two categories: solo cyclists and duo’s. You’d think that duo’s would be back quicker: you an keep up each others morale, and draft (which is forbidden for the solo riders). But does it work this way? Let’s look at the couples: do mixed sex couples on average finish before female solo riders? And how about the male-couples?
